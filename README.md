# What is this?
I've decided to better document when I set up services in my home lab, and this is what this is. 

# How do I use it?
- .sh files can be directly curl'ed and run
- .copy-command files can either be input via rubber ducky, or copied and pasted. These can't be run directly because you'll have to input stuff into executables like psql
